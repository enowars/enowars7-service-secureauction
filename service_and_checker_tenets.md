Service & Checker Tenets
----------------------------
General
A service MUST be able to store and load flags for a specified number of rounds
A service MUST NOT lose flags if it is restarted
A service MUST be rebuilt as fast as possible, no redundant build stages should be executed every time the service is built
A service MUST be able to endure the expected load
A service SHOULD NOT be a simple wrapper for a key-value database, and SHOULD expose more complex functionality
Rewriting a service with the same feature set SHOULD NOT be feasible within the timeframe of the contest
A service MAY be written in unexpected languages or using fun frameworks
---------------------------
Vulnerabilities
A vulnerability MUST be exploitable and result in a correct flag
A vulnerability MUST stay exploitable over the course of the complete game (I.e. auto delete old flags, if necessary)
A service SHOULD have more than one vulnerability
A service MUST have at least one complex vulnerability
Vulnerabilities SHOULD NOT be easily replayable
Every vulnerability MUST be fixable with reasonable effort and without breaking the checker
A service SHOULD NOT have unintended vulnerabilities
A service SHOULD NOT have vulnerabilities that allow the deletion but not the retrieval of flags
A service SHOULD NOT have vulnerabilities that allow only one attacker to extract a flag
A vulnerability MUST be exploitable without renting excessive computing resources
A vulnerability MUST be expoitable with reasonable amounts of network traffic
A service MUST have at least one "location" where flags are stored (called flag store)
A service MAY have additional flag stores, which requires a separate exploit to extract flags
---------------------------
Checker
A checker MUST check whether a flag is retrievable, and MUST NOT fail if the flag is retrievable, and MUST fail if the flag is not retrievable
A checker MUST NOT rely on information stored in the service in rounds before the flag was inserted
A checker MAY use information stored in previous rounds, if it gracefully handles the unexpected absence of that information
A checker MUST NOT crash or return unexpected results under any circumstances
A checker MUST log sufficiently detailed information that operators can handle complaints from participants
A checker MUST check the entire functionality of the service and report faulty behavior, even unrelated to the vulnerabilities
A checker SHOULD not be easily identified by the examination of network traffic
A checker SHOULD use unusual, incorrect or pseudomalicious input to detect network filters
