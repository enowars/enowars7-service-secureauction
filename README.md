The SecureAuction application is a web-based auction platform where users can create accounts, list items for auction, bid on items, change the the bids they made, generally manage there bids and items on the auction. The application handles regular and premium users differently. Regular users can create accounts, list items for auction, bid on items, and change the bids they made. They can also view the bids they received for their items and the bids they placed on other items. Furthermore, users have the ability to view the ranking of the bids they have received for the items they have listed in the auction. Premium users can do all of the above, as well as decrypt and ranking the bids they received for their items. The application uses RSA encryption to encrypt bids and decrypt them for premium users. The items are only 10 minutes on the auction afterwards they are removed (not visible) anymore. In addition to the primary functions, the SecureAuction application offers a dynamic countdown timer which is displayed on items still open for auction. Furthermore, a search bar function which is integrated into the platform.
