**Function**: `decryptAndRankUserBids($user_id, $item_id, $private_key_d, $bid, $user_type)`

During the development and testing process, an issue was identified with the handling of private keys. Specifically, private keys containing newline characters, carriage returns, or spaces (e.g., `6565655 56565656`) weren't processed correctly, leading to issues in ranking bids.

The suggested solution to this issue is the incorporation of the following line of code into the service:

```php
$private_key_d = str_replace(array("\n", "\r", " "), '', $private_key_d);
```


This line of code ensures that newline characters, carriage returns, and spaces are removed from private keys. As a result, private keys become a continuous string, as required for the function to perform as intended (e.g., 656565556565656).

This addition is particularly proposed for the decryptAndRankUserBids function, where its omission was identified. The same line has been effectively utilized in all other functions where decryption occurs.

In case the addition of the line into the service is not permissible. Ensure that the provided private keys are formatted as a continuous string (i.e., all in one line) without newline characters, carriage returns, or spaces.

By adopting one of these solutions, the correct functioning of the decryptAndRankUserBids function—and by extension, the accurate ranking of bids—should be secured.
